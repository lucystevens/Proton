# Proton (alpha)

Proton is a simple, lightweight dependency injection framework for Java.
It has been designed to be used for smaller projects where all the complexities, features, and additional dependencies of the Spring Framework are not needed.

## Including Proton in your project

Currently to include Proton in your project you must clone the repository and import the project dependency manually.
I am currently working on adding the dependency to the maven central repository.


## Documentation

Proton is currently in alpha and documentation will be updated as development continues.
